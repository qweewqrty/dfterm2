--- HOW TO BUILD DFTERM2 ---


Check that you have the following libraries and their development
files installed:

    gcc                   -   Any recent version appears to work. (Linux)
    or
    Microsoft Visual C++  -   Version 10 has been used to compile the Windows
                              version of dfterm2.

    PCRE                  -   For Windows binaries, version 8.02 has been
                              used.
                              http://www.pcre.org/

    Boost                 -   At least version 1.41.0. Dfterm2 uses
                              some libraries that need compiled
                              libraries from boost (threads).
                              http://www.boost.org/
    
    OpenSSL               -   Dfterm2 needs it for secure random number
                              generation and hashing algorithms.
                              http://www.openssl.org/

    ICU                   -   AKA International Components for Unicode.
                              Dfterm2 is being built with version 4.4
                              but it might work with older versions.
                              http://site.icu-project.org/

    Lua 5.1               -   Lua is a scripting language. It is used
                              for configuration files.

    CMake                 -   The tool dfterm2 is built with.
                              http://www.cmake.org/



--- BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS --- 

    --- On Linux ---

    1. Obtain the source code. If you are reading this,
       chances are you already have the code.

    $ git clone git://genodeen.net/dfterm2
    $ cd dfterm2
    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update
    
    2. Run CMake to configure the building system.
       If this step goes wrong, there can be missing
       libraries or just misnamed libraries. At the moment
       there is no extensive building testing platform for dfterm2.
       CMake can be invoked with various parameters and
       also has a GUI. Refer to its manual for more information.

       The following command makes optimized binaries and
       it usually defaults to plain Makefiles.

    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
    
    3. Build it.

    $ make

    4. Dfterm2 is ready. At the moment there is no automated
       installer. You can run it from source directory
       by running ./dfterm2

    $ ./dfterm2

    5. You probably want to add an admin account before
       you log in though. This creates an admin account
       with nickname "Adeon" and password "s3cret_p4ssw0rd".
       If you drop the "admin" from end, it will create
       a normal user instead.

    $ ./dfterm2_configure --adduser Adeon s3cret_p4ssw0rd admin

    6. You can configure slots and games from inside dfterm2 by
       telnetting to it.

    $ telnet 127.0.0.1 8000

    7. Hopefully, the rest is intuitive. If not, then bad for you, ehehehehe.






    --- On Windows ---

    1. Grab yourself Microsoft Visual C++ 10 and Microsoft Windows SDK.

    2. You likely need to manually either download development versions of
       all libraries you need for Windows or compile them all yourself.
       It can be complex, refer to each packages instructions.

    3. Using CMake for Windows, configure dfterm2 and compile it with MSVC++

    4. Starting and configuring dfterm2 is the same as with Linux, in 
       steps #4 and #5.

    5. There's a NSIS installer script in root directory that you can use
       to build an installer package.
